# static-boilerplate

Rather than the fully-loaded approach of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) or [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), this is a minimal starting point for my static site projects.

## Features

- [Google's jQuery CDN](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery)
- [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- Sticky footer stays at the bottom of the page when content is less than page height
- Includes a set of commonly-used [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) mixins
- Mobile viewport meta settings

## LESS

I use [NodeLESS](https://github.com/btmills/NodeLESS) to compile LESS stylesheets as they're edited and [Vogue](http://aboutcode.net/vogue/) to reload compiled CSS without a refresh.

## Contributing

I created this as a matter of personal convenience, but if you find it useful as well, great! I'll happily consider all pull requests, but again, this is for my projects.
